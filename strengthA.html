                        as they work on more than one muscles than any other exercises 
                        Many of these muscles help power you through daily tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, bending, or carrying heavy loads. 
                        Adding squats to your workouts can help boost your exercise performance, decrease your risk of injury, and keep you moving more easily throughout the day

                 <p class="bodyp">
                    Glute training is key for increasing strength, power, and performance
                    While many strength, power, and fitness athletes spend most of their weight training performing squats, deadlifts, pressing, Olympic lifts, and more, most athletes and coaches integrate movements like the glute bridge within a training program to address muscle weaknesses or as a corrective exercise.
                    Knee and lower back pain is common while training for strength
                    Stronger glutes can relieve spinal extension stress, help to fully extend the hips, and can act as an antagonist during squatting movements to help stabilize and balance out the forces on the knee.
